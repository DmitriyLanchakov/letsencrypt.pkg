Description: Let's Encrypt main client
 The objective of Let's Encrypt and the ACME (Automated Certificate
 Management Environment) protocol is to make it possible to set up an
 HTTPS server and have it automatically obtain a browser-trusted
 certificate, without any human intervention. This is accomplished by
 running a certificate management agent on the web server.
